There are five modes in which the router can be configured:
<ol>
<li>Wireless Access-Point(AP) Mode
<li>Client Mode
<li>Repeater Mode
<li>Router Mode
<li>Bridge Mode
</ol>


<strong><em>Wireless Access Point(AP) Mode:</em></strong>
<dd>The router is connected to a wired network and transforms the wired internet access into wireless so that multiple devices can share the internet.</dd>

<strong><em>Client Mode:</em></strong>
<dd>The device is connected to another device via ethernet card and acts as an adapter to send/receive the wireless signal from your wireless network</dd>

<br>

<strong><em>Repeater Mode:</em></strong>
<dd>The device copies and reinforces the existing wireless signal to extend the coverage of the signal. So the network name(SSID) and password don't change. This mode is especially useful for a large space to eliminate signal-blind corners.</dd>

<strong><em>Router Mode:</em></strong>
<dd>The device is connected to a DSL or cable modem and works as a Regular Wireless Router</dd>

<br>

<strong><em>Bridge Mode:</em></strong>
<dd>The device borrows existing wireless internet and broadcasts it using a different network name(SSID) and password</dd>
