Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively. You can learn to use Python and see almost immediate gains in productivity and lower maintenance costs.

Python is a remarkably powerful dynamic programming language that is used in a wide variety of application domains. Python is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Ruby, Scheme or Java. Some of its key distinguishing features include:

--very clear, readable syntax
--strong introspection capabilities
--intuitive object orientation
--natural expression of procedural code
--full modularity, supporting hierarchical packages
--exception-based error handling
--very high level dynamic data types
--extensive standard libraries and third party modules for virtually every task
--extensions and modules easily written in C, C++ (or Java for Jython, or .NET languages for IronPython)
--embeddable within applications as a scripting interface

The Python implementation is under an open source license that makes it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. The Python license is administered by the Python Software Foundation.
