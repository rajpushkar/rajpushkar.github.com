		<p>Hi! Today we were conducting the ICT Training at <a href="http://iic.ac.in">IIC, UDSC</a> which aims at promoting the use of Open-Source Softwares in the University and we were giving the Faculty hands-on with Ubuntu. There were many questions that arose out of the crowd and one out of them was how to write characters with <strong>diacritical marks</strong>(e.g ë, õ) in <strong>LibreOffice Writer</strong>. I found the question interesting as I got a new thing to explore. So I started searching for the solution and within few minutes I found one.</p>

<br>


<p>I am demonstrating the procedure below:</p>

<br>


<p>First of all go <a href="http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/fr/project/ComposeSpecialCharacters">here</a> and download the extension or directly download it from <a href="http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/fr/download/4646">here</a></p>

<br>


<p>Now Open the LibreOffice Writer and go to the <i>tools</i> tab and select <i>Extension manager.</i>
<img src="/images/Snapshot1.png"></p>

<br>


<p>The following window will appear which prompts you to add an extension.
<img src="/images/Snapshot2.png">
Click on <i>Add</i> and go to the directory where the file has been downloaded, select the file and click <i>Open</i> as demonstrated below.
<img src="/images/Snapshot3.png">
Now the <i>Extension Software License Agreement</i> Window will appear you will see the <i>Accept</i> button is disabled. Scroll till end and it will become active, click Accept and close the next window that appears.
<img src="/images/Snapshot4.png">
<img src="/images/Snapshot5.png">
Now close and relaunch the LibreOffice Writer and you can see that a new option named <i>Compose Character</i> appears under the <i>Insert</i> tab.
<img src="/images/Snapshot6.png">
On clicking the compose character option you will see a window(shown below) appearing on your screen that displays the information on how to use the keyboard shortcuts to enter the special characters on the editor. But before using the shortcuts you need to set the CSC(Compose Special Character) Shortcut key-combination.
<img src="/images/Snapshot7.png">
Click on the CSC Shortcut tab and you will be greeted with a new window that prompts you to set a key-combination for composing special characetrs.
<img src="/images/Snapshot8.png">
Here, as you can see, I have chosen the <strong>alt+F3</strong> key-combination, you can choose any combination like <strong>shift+F2, alt+ctrl+m, ctrl+g</strong> but make sure the combination you choose should not conflict with any other shortcut already defined for the editor.
Click <i>OK</i> and also on the next two windows that appear click <i>OK</i>
<img src="/images/Snapshot9.png">
<img src="/images/Snapshot10.png">
Now the following window shows you the key-pair to use for writing the words with diacritical marks.
<img src="/images/Snapshot11.png">
Suppose you want to write &ldquo;Ø&rdquo; then as shown first you have to type &ldquo;O/&rdquo; and then you need to press the CSC key-combination set by you, which in my case is <strong>alt+F3</strong>
Simillarly to type any other character just look for its key-pair value and then afte typing in the key-pair value press your CSC key and you are done.
As simple as that!</p>

		<p>Hi all! I have been using octopress blog for a couple of months now. I find it very interesting to work with. But a problem I used to face with Octopress is that I was unable to operate it from multiple machines. The complete setup was on my laptop and if I want to post anything onto the blog from a system in my institute, I can&rsquo;t.
As long as my laptop was serving my purpose I didn&rsquo;t bother but one day my hard-disk crashed and then I was left with no other option then finding a solution to operate the blog from multiple places.</p>

<br>


<p>I had the basic understanding as to what does different folders inside the octopress folder actually mean.</p>

<br>


<p>The octopress repository cotains two branches: <strong>Source</strong> and <strong>Master</strong>
The Source branch contains the files necessary to generate the blog and the actual blog is contained in the Master branch.
While configuring the blog initially the source branch is cloned into the folder named octopress and the files of the actual blog are cloned into the sub-folder named _deploy.</p>

<br>


<p>All the files and folders are pushed to the Source branch when we run the <strong>git push origin source</strong> command on terminal except the <strong>_deploy</strong> folder which contains the files of the actual blog and are pushed to master branch automatically when we run <strong>rake deploy</strong> command.</p>

<br>


<p>So the steps that I followed are as follows:</p>

<h2>Step.1</h2>

<p>I Cloned the Source branch to a local directory named Octopress:</p>

<pre><code>git clone -b source git@github.com:username/username.github.com.git octopress
</code></pre>

<h2>Step.2</h2>

<p>CD to the octopress directory just created and cloned the master branch into a directory named _deploy:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:username/username.github.com.git _deploy
</code></pre>

<h2>Step.3</h2>

<p>Then I installed ruby as follows:</p>

<pre><code>curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
rvm install 1.9.3
rvm use 1.9.3
rvm rubygems latest
</code></pre>

<p>after this I configured everything according to the octopress guidelines:</p>

<pre><code>gem install bundler
bundle install
rake setup_github_pages
</code></pre>

<p>This prompted me to enter read/write URL for my blog</p>

<pre><code>Enter the read/write url for your repository
(For example, 'git@github.com:username/username.github.com)
</code></pre>

<p>Here I have omitted the step <strong>rake install</strong> because it installs the default theme to the octopress and there was already a theme installed on my blog. If you want to install the default octopress theme then run the command <strong>rake install</strong> before running <strong>rake setup_github_pages</strong></p>

<br>


<p>That&rsquo;s it. Now I have a complete copy of my octopress blog.
Now I can do whatever I like as i used to do before loosing my blog.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to operate your blog from multiple places</strong> you just need to setup a copy of your blog locally on all the machines and then before making changes from any machine do the following:</p>

<br>


<p>Go to the <strong>octopress</strong> directory and pull the <strong>source</strong> branch:</p>

<pre><code>cd /path/to/octopress/directory
git pull origin source
</code></pre>

<p>Go to the <strong>_deploy</strong> directory and pull the <strong>master</strong> branch:</p>

<pre><code>cd _deploy
git pull origin master
</code></pre>

<p>Make changes and push:</p>

<pre><code>git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin source
</code></pre>

<p>Deploy:</p>

<pre><code>rake generate
rake deploy
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s it!</p>
